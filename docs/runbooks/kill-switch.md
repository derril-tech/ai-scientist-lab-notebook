# Kill Switch Runbook

## Overview

This runbook covers emergency procedures for immediately stopping all system operations (kill switch) and safely restarting services when critical issues are detected.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Docker/Kubernetes cluster
- Database admin credentials
- Infrastructure access (Terraform)
- Emergency contact list

## Kill Switch Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- System resource exhaustion (>95% CPU/Memory)
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Worker process crashes (>3 consecutive)
- Security breach detection
- Data corruption detected

### Manual Triggers
- Critical security vulnerability
- Data integrity issues
- Performance degradation affecting all users
- Emergency maintenance required

## Emergency Kill Switch Procedure

### 1. Immediate System Shutdown

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency-kill-switch.sh

echo "=== EMERGENCY KILL SWITCH ACTIVATED $(date) ==="

# 1. Stop all application services
echo "Stopping application services..."
docker-compose stop api workers frontend

# 2. Stop background workers
echo "Stopping background workers..."
docker-compose stop pdf-worker table-worker embed-worker rag-worker summary-worker plot-worker bundle-worker

# 3. Stop monitoring services
echo "Stopping monitoring services..."
docker-compose stop prometheus grafana sentry

# 4. Stop message queues (preserve messages)
echo "Stopping message queues..."
docker-compose stop nats redis

# 5. Update system status
echo "System shutdown complete. All services stopped."
echo "Status: EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN"
```

### 2. Database Protection

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# protect-database.sh

echo "=== Database Protection Started ==="

# 1. Set database to read-only mode
psql -d ai_lab_notebook -c "SET default_transaction_read_only = on;"

# 2. Disconnect all active connections (except admin)
psql -d ai_lab_notebook -c "
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'ai_lab_notebook'
  AND pid <> pg_backend_pid()
  AND usename != 'postgres';"

# 3. Create emergency backup
echo "Creating emergency backup..."
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres ai_lab_notebook | gzip > /tmp/emergency-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql.gz

# 4. Upload backup to secure location
aws s3 cp /tmp/emergency-backup-*.sql.gz s3://ai-lab-notebook-backups/emergency/

echo "=== Database Protection Completed ==="
```

### 3. Infrastructure Isolation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# isolate-infrastructure.sh

echo "=== Infrastructure Isolation Started ==="

# 1. Block external traffic to API
echo "Blocking external API access..."
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-xxxxxxxxx \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 3001 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

# 2. Block external traffic to frontend
echo "Blocking external frontend access..."
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-xxxxxxxxx \

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Kill Switch Metrics

```sql
-- Kill switch activations
SELECT

  COUNT(*) as activations,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (resolved_at - created_at))) as avg_downtime_seconds
FROM kill_switch_log
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY activation_date;

-- Recovery time analysis
SELECT 
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (resolved_at - created_at))) as avg_recovery_time_seconds,
  MAX(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (resolved_at - created_at))) as max_recovery_time_seconds,
  MIN(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (resolved_at - created_at))) as min_recovery_time_seconds
FROM kill_switch_log
WHERE status = 'resolved'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```
